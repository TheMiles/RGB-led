RGB-led
=======

A very simple example, about accessing a RGBB led on an arduino using pygtk
This project keeps all the scribbles while playing around with my arduino. 

Consists of two components. One part is for the arduino controlling the led
(part number lf5waembgmbw). The other part is a GUI (using pygtk) consisting 
of four different sliders, one for each color channel (the led has two blue
channel). Both parts communicate via serial port.
